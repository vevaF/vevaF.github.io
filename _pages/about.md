Welcome! 

I am currently a postdoc at TU Delft - jointly at the Delft Institute for Applied Mathematics and the Department of Biotechnology. 

Blabla I'm a PhD student in my final year in the [MAC-MIGS](https://www.mac-migs.ac.uk/) CDT, a joint doctoral program for applied mathematics, supported by both Heriot Watt University and University of Edinburgh in Edinburgh, UK. During the last few years I have been exploring different approaches to modelling collective cell migration, ranging from individual based biased random walk models to (structured) Keller-Segel type models. This work was/ is done in collaboration with my supervisors [Kevin Painter](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=kevin.painter), [Mariya Ptashnyk](https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~mp91/) and [Linus Schumacher](https://www.ed.ac.uk/regenerative-medicine/research/linus-schumacher).

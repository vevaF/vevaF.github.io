# Welcome! 

I am a mathematical biologist working at the interface of mathematics and the life sciences.  
My research focuses on developing and analysing mathematical models to understand how cells and microbes behave collectively ‚Äî from **bacterial biofilms** and their ecological interactions, to **cell migration** during development and disease. By combining individual-based, continuum, and structured population approaches, I aim to uncover the principles behind **self-organisation, pattern formation, and coordination in living systems**.

Currently, I am a postdoc at **TU Delft**, working jointly at the [Delft Institute for Applied Mathematics](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/applied-mathematics) and the [Department of Biotechnology](https://www.tudelft.nl/tnw/over-faculteit/afdelingen/biotechnology), where I collaborate with [Havva Yolda≈ü]() and [Rebeca Gonzalez Cabaleiro](https://www.tudelft.nl/tnw/over-faculteit/afdelingen/biotechnology/research-sections/environmental-biotechnology/rebeca-gonzalez-cabaleiro).  

Previously, I completed my PhD in the [MAC-MIGS](https://www.mac-migs.ac.uk/) Centre for Doctoral Training, a joint doctoral programme in applied mathematics between *Heriot-Watt University* and the *University of Edinburgh*. My doctoral work was supervised by [Kevin Painter](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=kevin.painter), [Mariya Ptashnyk](https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~mp91/) and [Linus Schumacher](https://www.ed.ac.uk/regenerative-medicine/research/linus-schumacher), and focused on mathematical models of **collective cell migration**.

## Research interests  

### Multi-species bacterial populations with ecological interactions
In my current postdoctoral work, I study **multi-species bacterial communities**, focusing on how different types of ecological interactions ‚Äî such as **competition, commensalism, and neutralism** ‚Äî shape their spatial organisation and long-term dynamics. These models aim to capture the balance between species, how they coexist, and under which conditions one might dominate or suppress another. A key goal is to connect these theoretical insights with experimental observations of microbial aggregates and biotechnological applications.

### Structured population models for heterogeneous, migrating cell populations  
A key theme in my work is the development of **structured population models**, where cell populations are described not only by their spatial distribution but also by **heterogeneous traits** (e.g. phenotypes, receptor expressions, or intracellular variables). These models take the form of non-local partial differential equations and allow the analysis of phenomena such as **travelling waves, pattern formation, and self-organisation** in cell migration.  
- *Trait-structured chemotaxis: Exploring ligand-receptor dynamics and travelling wave properties in an extended Keller-Segel model* (to appear in 2025, [link](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.18947))  
- *Self-organisation in trait-structured Keller-Segel models for collective chemotaxis* (in preparation)
- *Mathematical modeling of collective cell migration: Cell trait structures and intracellular variables* (PhD thesis, [link](https://www.ros.hw.ac.uk/handle/10399/5113))    

### Individual-based models for cell migration and intracellular states  
Cells often migrate collectively while responding to chemical cues in their environment. To capture this, I have developed **biased random walk models** that describe how individual cells move, interact, and adapt their behaviour based on both **external signals** and their **intracellular states**. These models aim to bridge the gap between cell-level dynamics and the emergence of large-scale migratory patterns.  
- *A biased random walk approach for modeling the collective chemotaxis of neural crest cells* ([link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-024-02047-2))  
- *Mathematical modeling of collective cell migration: Cell trait structures and intracellular variables* (PhD thesis, [link](https://www.ros.hw.ac.uk/handle/10399/5113))  

### Biofilm models for quorum sensing and quorum quenching  
I am interested in how microbial populations coordinate their behaviour through **quorum sensing**, and how this can be disrupted via **quorum quenching** strategies. Together with collaborators, I worked on models that couple biofilm growth with quorum sensing signalling molecules and their enzymatic degradation. This research also explored possible applications of quorum quenching as an **adjuvant to antibiotic treatment**.

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time in nature ‚Äî running or hiking through local forests and dune parks, swimming at the beach all year round, and more recently also cycling, which lets me explore places that are a little out of reach on foot. I‚Äôm also a cat enthusiast and volunteer regularly at a cat shelter; so if you live in the area around Den Haag, Netherlands and are thinking about adopting a cat, feel free to reach out ‚Äî I meowght have some insider tips! üêæ
